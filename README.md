# Lumina Write

## What is Lumina Write?

**Lumina Write is a Google Docs–style collaborative editor for the web:** you and your teammates edit the same document at the same time, see who is online, and discuss the text with comments. You sign in, create or open a doc, share it with the right permissions, and start writing—nothing to install.

---

## Why is this interesting?

**Real-time collaboration is hard.** If two people edit the same paragraph at once, a naive app can scramble text, lose someone’s work, or show different versions to different people.

**This project tackles that head-on.** It keeps a single shared copy of each document **in sync across everyone’s screens** as fast as the network allows. Under the hood it uses a **CRDT** (a structured way to merge edits so conflicts resolve predictably) and a **dedicated realtime channel** so typing, presence, and saved state stay aligned—not “email the file back and forth,” but **live co-editing** with roles and permissions layered on top.

---

## How it works (simple idea)

Picture **one shared notebook** that everyone is looking at. When you add a sentence, that change is sent through a **coordinator** (the app and sync service) so the same words appear for your teammates—and when they type, you see it too. The notebook also **saves to durable storage** so the document is still there when you come back later. The sections below explain how that idea maps to code, servers, and the database.

Real-time collaborative rich-text editor: Next.js + TipTap, **Yjs CRDT** over Socket.IO, Supabase Auth, and PostgreSQL with Row Level Security.

**Live app:** https://lumina-write-editor.vercel.app/

### Why this stack (high level)

- **Real-time, conflict-free editing** — Yjs CRDT merges concurrent changes deterministically; great for live collaboration.
- **Secure by design** — Multi-layer access control: authenticated API routes and **Supabase RLS** aligned with app rules.
- **Modular, scalability-ready architecture** — Web app and dedicated realtime **sync service** separate concerns; clear path to horizontal scaling with a shared sync layer when you need it.

---

## What you can do

- Sign in (Supabase: Google OAuth or email/password).
- Create documents, share them with roles, and request access to private docs (owners **and admins** manage invites, roles, and approvals).
- Co-edit in real time with presence and cursor colors.
- Comment, resolve, and manage comments by role.
- Save and restore version snapshots.

---

## How it works (flows for contributors)

These paths are the fastest way to navigate the codebase.

### 1. Opening a document and connecting to live sync

1. User opens `/doc/[id]` (`apps/web/src/app/doc/[id]/page.tsx`).
2. The page uses **`useCollabEditor`** (`apps/web/src/hooks/useCollabEditor.ts`): creates a **`Y.Doc`** and **`Awareness`** (presence/cursors).
3. The hook opens a Socket.IO client to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SYNC_SERVER_URL`, passing the Supabase **`access_token`** in `auth.token`.
4. On **`connect`**, the client emits **`doc:join`** with the document id.
5. The sync server (`apps/sync-server/src/index.ts`) verifies the user in **`io.use`**, checks membership with **`assertDocumentAccess`**, joins the Socket.IO room, then:
   - Loads or creates the server-side Yjs doc via **`getOrCreateDoc`** (`apps/sync-server/src/yjsManager.ts`) — seeded from **`documents.yjs_state`** in Postgres if present.
   - Emits **`doc:load`** (full state as base64) to that client.
   - Sends **`awareness:sync`** so presence can align.
6. The client applies **`doc:load`** with `Y.applyUpdate(..., 'remote')` so TipTap stays in sync with the server’s canonical doc.

**Rejection path:** if the user cannot access the document, the server emits **`doc:rejected`**; the hook surfaces **`syncRejectMessage`** and stops treating the session as connected.

### 2. Typing and persisting the document body

1. TipTap edits mutate the shared **`Y.Doc`**.
2. Local Yjs updates (non-remote origin) are sent as **`doc:update`** with a base64-encoded update.
3. The server **`resolveSocketAccess`** requires a **write** role (`owner`, `admin`, `editor`), applies the update with **`Y.applyUpdate`**, **`schedulePersist`**, and broadcasts **`doc:broadcast`** to everyone else in the room.
4. **`schedulePersist`** batches writes on a short interval and persists **`documents.yjs_state`** via the Supabase service role (`yjsManager.ts`)—an **optimized persistence strategy** that keeps collaboration responsive with minimal latency.

Comments, sharing, and version rows are **not** carried on this socket path; only the Yjs document state is.

### 3. Presence (cursors / who’s online)

1. Awareness changes from the local client emit **`awareness:update`**.
2. The server echoes **`awareness:diff`** to peers; **`applyAwarenessUpdate`** runs on the client.
3. Cursor colors are chosen in **`useCollabEditor`** using **`cursorColors.ts`** to reduce collisions.

### 4. REST API vs realtime

| Concern | Where it lives |
| --- | --- |
| Document list, create, share, access requests, versions, comments | Next.js **Route Handlers** under `apps/web/src/app/api/` → Supabase (RLS + server checks). |
| Live body text + presence | **Yjs + Socket.IO** on `apps/sync-server` as above. |

Main editor UI: **`Editor.tsx`**. Comment UI and API: **`CommentsPanel.tsx`**, **`/api/documents/[id]/comments`**.

## AI tools and how they were used

This project leaned on several AI assistants during planning, design, and implementation. The notes below are for transparency with collaborators and future maintainers.

### ChatGPT and Claude (planning and architecture)

Used for **early project planning** and **architecture design**, including **efficient** use of Supabase, Vercel, and Render so requests and responses flow smoothly end to end.

That work included brainstorming **what features** could make the platform stronger and more distinctive, the **tradeoffs** of adding each idea, high-level **architecture**, **schemas**, and **data flow** (client → app/server → backend services → database): what should be **stored**, how it should be **retrieved**, and how pieces connect end to end.

### Stitch (UI design) and Cursor MCP

**Stitch** was used to generate **frontend layouts and design directions**. The UI **typography and color direction** take inspiration from **Anthropic’s** design language: a **single, balanced palette** that reads well in **daytime and nighttime** use without forcing a separate “dark mode vs light mode” build—one subtle theme that stays easy on the eyes.

The **Stitch MCP** was connected **inside Cursor** so design ideas could feed directly into building the frontend in the editor.

### Codex (VS Code / CLI agent) and integration

The **OpenAI Codex** CLI agent (in VS Code) was used to help **implement the backend end to end** and **wire the frontend to the backend** (APIs, sync server, and app integration).

### Where it runs

| Piece | Host |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend (Next.js app) | **Vercel** |
| Backend (realtime sync server) | **Render** |
| Database (SQL, auth, RLS) | **Supabase** |

### Deployment and operations

Frontend and sync services are deployed for **cost-efficient scaling** (e.g. Vercel + Render). A **health-check schedule** (external cron hitting `/health`) helps keep services responsive under typical load. Production hardening can add dedicated instances, autoscaling, and monitoring as traffic grows.

---

## Database

Core tables: `profiles`, `documents` (includes `yjs_state`), `document_members`, `document_versions`, `document_comments`, `document_access_requests`.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    PROFILES ||--o{ DOCUMENTS : owns
    PROFILES ||--o{ DOCUMENT_MEMBERS : belongs_to
    DOCUMENTS ||--o{ DOCUMENT_MEMBERS : has_members
    DOCUMENTS ||--o{ DOCUMENT_VERSIONS : has_versions
    DOCUMENTS ||--o{ DOCUMENT_COMMENTS : has_comments
    DOCUMENTS ||--o{ DOCUMENT_ACCESS_REQUESTS : has_requests
```

**RLS:** Policies on `documents` and `document_members` must not recurse. This repo uses **`SECURITY DEFINER`** helpers in `schema.sql` (e.g. `is_document_member`, `is_document_owner`) to break cycles.

---

## Role-based access

Roles are stored in Postgres as enum **`app_role`** on `document_members` (`viewer`, `commenter`, `editor`, `admin`, `owner`). The **document owner** is always `documents.owner_id`; they are not required to have a row in `document_members`, but the app may upsert an `owner` row for consistency.

### What each role can do

**Precedence:** On a document, **owner outranks admin**. The owner can **change or revoke any admin** (or any member) from Share; an admin **cannot** modify or remove the owner. Admins otherwise mirror the owner’s sharing powers for everyone who is not the owner.

| Capability | owner | admin | editor | commenter | viewer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Precedence** (1 = highest authority) | **1** | **2** | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| Edit document body (live sync) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| Live presence (see who’s online) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Comments: add | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Comments: resolve / moderate | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| Comments: read | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Share:** invite users, change roles, revoke (not the owner) | ✓ | ✓ | | | |
| **Access requests:** approve or decline pending requests | ✓ | ✓ | | | |
| Request a role or access (if not owner) | | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Owner-only:** rename the document (title), delete the document, and **cannot** be removed or have their role changed via sharing—the owner row is fixed in the UI and API.

**Admin vs owner:** Admins have the same **sharing and approval** powers as the owner for everyone **except** the owner account. Only the owner can transfer true ownership (not implemented as a separate action here—the owner remains `documents.owner_id`). Admins can assign or revoke **admin** for **other** members (not the owner). The **owner** always has final say: they can demote or revoke **any** admin, or change any role, because owner precedence is strictly above admin.

**Viewer / commenter / editor:** They **cannot** open Share or approve requests. They **can** request access or a **role change** (viewer, commenter, editor, admin); those requests appear in the **editor notifications** (bell) for **both the owner and every admin** on that document, who can approve or decline.

### Where this is enforced

- **HTTP:** `apps/web/src/app/api/documents/[id]/share/route.ts` — invite and role changes require **owner or admin** (`assertOwnerOrAdmin`). Targeting the document owner’s user id is rejected.
- **HTTP:** `apps/web/src/app/api/documents/[id]/access/route.ts` — `GET` returns `pendingRequests` and `canModerateAccessRequests` for **owner and admin**; `PATCH` (approve/reject) allows **owner or admin**.
- **Realtime:** `apps/sync-server` — live edits require a **write** role: `owner`, `admin`, or `editor` (`assertDocumentWriteAccess`).

If your database was created before `admin` existed on `app_role`, run `supabase/patches/ensure_app_role_admin.sql` once in the Supabase SQL Editor.

---

## Local development

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+, npm, Supabase project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sudhan1112/Lumina-Write-editor.git
cd Lumina-Write-editor
npm install
cp .env.example apps/web/.env.local
cp .env.example apps/sync-server/.env
```

Configure **`apps/web/.env.local`** (anon + service role, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SYNC_SERVER_URL`, etc.) and **`apps/sync-server/.env`** (`SUPABASE_*`, `PORT`, `CLIENT_URL`). See `.env.example` for variable names.

**Database:** run `supabase/schema.sql` on a new project. For existing DBs, apply patches in `supabase/patches/` in order as needed.

**Run** (two terminals, or use `dev:all`):

```bash
npm run dev:server    # sync server, default :4000
npm run dev:web       # Next.js, default :3000
```

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

Root scripts: `dev:web`, `dev:server`, `dev:all`, `build:web`, `build:server`.

---

## Security

- **Strict access control** is enforced through **API-level validation** (authenticated Next.js route handlers) and **Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)** on tables where clients use the anon key.
- **Service role keys** stay server-only (`apps/web` API routes and `apps/sync-server`). Never ship them in client bundles.
- The **sync server** accepts only valid Supabase JWTs, then validates **document membership and roles** against Postgres before live edits or presence updates.

---

## Tradeoffs and design decisions

The architecture is intentionally optimized for **rapid iteration**, **real-time performance**, and **clear paths to production-grade scaling**—especially within typical cloud free-tier constraints.

### Real-time performance vs persistence frequency

To keep editing **smooth and low-latency**, document updates are **batched and persisted on short intervals** rather than on every keystroke.

- **Benefit:** Responsive collaboration and efficient database use.
- **Tradeoff:** Persistence is **near real-time** rather than synchronous per keystroke.
- **Future scope:** Tunable intervals, streaming, or stronger durability guarantees if product requirements demand it.

### In-memory collaboration layer

Live document state is held in the sync service’s **working memory** for **high-speed** merging and broadcast; state is **reconciled with Postgres** on an optimized schedule.

- **Benefit:** Very fast real-time sync for concurrent editors.
- **Tradeoff:** Multi-instance deployments need a **coordinated sync layer** (e.g. shared storage or affinity)—a standard next step when scaling out.
- **Future scope:** Distributed state (e.g. Redis-backed rooms, shared CRDT backends).

### Layered authorization

Access is enforced through **API validation** plus **Supabase RLS**, so permissions stay expressive and auditable across HTTP and database access patterns.

- **Benefit:** Flexible roles (owner, admin, editor, commenter, viewer) with defense in depth.
- **Tradeoff:** Application and database policies must stay aligned as features evolve.
- **Future scope:** Stricter declarative policies or centralized policy services if the product grows.

### Optimized access validation

High-frequency paths **cache access checks briefly** to reduce database load during active editing.

- **Benefit:** Lower latency and fewer round-trips under load.
- **Tradeoff:** Permission changes propagate with **near real-time** consistency.
- **Future scope:** Event-driven invalidation for stricter immediacy where required.

### Cost-efficient deployment

The stack targets **efficient** hosting on modern platforms (e.g. Vercel, Render, Supabase).

- **Benefit:** Low cost to build, demo, and iterate.
- **Tradeoff:** Shared-tier hosting can show variable latency under load unless tuned for production.
- **Future scope:** Dedicated instances, autoscaling, and observability for production SLAs.
